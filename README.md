# tf-multi-account-producer
Demo for TFC / TFE to perform a single TF Run against multiple Cloud Accounts.
The flow is:
- USE TF 0.15.0 AND NEWER!!!
- set your Github Owner (username) and Github Token
- set a HCL2 Variable map of all of your Cloud Providers, with Cloud Accounts
- run this HCL2 code, either locally or within a TFE / TFC Workspace
- this will render a template called "providers.tf"
- the "providers.tf" file will then be send with "git commit" to a Github Enterprise git repo
- the secondary Github Enterprise git repo can now perform operations across multiple cloud accounts



```shell
# create a Git Repo called "tf-multi-account-consumer", or set your own by defining
# an HCL2 Variable called "git_repo_consumer_name"

# configure a Github OAuth Token, as Environment Variables, preferably in "~/.bashrc"
# https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs#token
# https://github.com/settings/tokens
export GITHUB_OWNER="<your_github_username>"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<github_oauth_token>"

# test your Github OAuth Token is set correctly
# you should see the output "HTTP/2 200"
curl -s -I -u ${GITHUB_OWNER}:${GITHUB_TOKEN} https://api.github.com/user | grep "HTTP/2 200"



# Run locally
terraform validate -var-file=terraform.tfvars
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars



# Run within TFE / TFC
# Create a TF Workspace, setup a VCS connection to this Git Repo
# configure a TF Workspace Environment Variable called "GITHUB_OWNER"
# configure a TF Workspace Environment Variable called "GITHUB_TOKEN"
# configure a TF Workspace Variable called "cloud_providers"
